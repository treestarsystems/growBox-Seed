# growBox-Install
Install script for all growBox projects

PLEASE NOTE:  
This is meant to be ran on a newly installed system that does  
not have things like git and other necessary tools. I suggest  
wget or copy+paste the growBox-Install.sh script.

Example of retrieval: For certificate issues use "--no-check-certificate"
For certificate issues use "wget --no-check-certificate"
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjnshosting/growBox-Install/master/growBox-Install.sh
```
cURL may need to be installed when using minimal versions of an OS.
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjnshosting/growBox-Install/master/growBox-Install.sh -o growBox-Install.sh
```
